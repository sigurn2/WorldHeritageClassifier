    You are an expert about world heritage
    I will give you a list {attrs}ï¼Œ their theme is {target}
    Limitation: options less than 26
    You should do my orders step by step
    1. summarize these values and divide them into some abstract types
    2. use a scientific way to merge them into more reasonable types and reduce the redundancy
    3. use a scientific way to merge them into more reasonable types and make sure every option is exclusive
    Your answer should like:
    A: Engineering innovation

    )
    print(c.choices[0].message.content)
